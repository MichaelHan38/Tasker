# A Simple to-do app

Project overview: small todo list app with calendar visualization  
Team member: Michael Han


## Must have features:
- [x] Basic functionality
  - [x] Ability to add, mark done, & delete todo items  (done in class)
  - [x] Modifications made to each todo item persist in CoreData 
  - [x] CoreData querying by dates 
- [X] 2nd screen: monthly task 
  - [X] Display calendar and todo items on selected dates 
- [ ] Styling & visualization
  - [X] Display date of active todo list
  - [ ] Style monthly calendar


## Nice to have features:
- [ ] Home screen show tasks for the next 7 days
- [ ] "Add" button for each day on the home screen
- [ ] Description section for todo items
- [ ] Each calendar date displays the number of todo items


## Limitations:
- Functionality to add task in Calendar View is temporarily removed due to bug with persistent container getting loaded multiple times. Tthis eventually causes the app to crash.
- Eventually I'd like to implement a category/label system where each task is displayed and grouped based on its category/label.
